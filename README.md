 covid-19-survival-prediction
this project aims to predict whether a COVID-19 patient is likely to survive or not based on various features (e.g., age, gender, patient type). The prediction is performed using a trained machine learning model, which takes input features and classifies the survival status of the patient.

Project Overview
With the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, predicting patient outcomes can be critical for resource allocation and patient care. This project leverages machine learning to predict a patient’s survival based on personal and health-related features, such as age, gender, and patient type (inpatient/outpatient).

Dataset
The model was trained on a dataset containing COVID-19 patient information. Key features include:

age: Patient’s age.
gender: Gender of the patient (encoded as 0 = Female, 1 = Male).
patient_type: Whether the patient was treated as an inpatient (1) or outpatient (0).
Additional features related to patient health conditions and COVID-19 symptoms.
Please note: The dataset file "Covid Data.csv" needs to be loaded in the same directory as the project for the notebook to run correctly.

Installation
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/COVID-19-Survival-Prediction.git
cd COVID-19-Survival-Prediction
Install Required Libraries: Install the libraries needed to run the notebook.

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Load the Dataset: Ensure that the dataset file (Covid Data.csv) is present in the project directory.

Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the data_science_project.ipynb notebook and execute the cells sequentially to preprocess data, train the model, and run predictions.

Prediction Example: Use the following code snippet to predict the survival status of a patient:

python
Copy code
input_data = (1, 0, 0, 37, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1)
input_data_as_numpy_array = np.asarray(input_data)
input_data_reshaped = input_data_as_numpy_array.reshape(1, -1)
prediction = model.predict(input_data_reshaped)

if prediction[0] == 0:
    print('The Person is alive')
else:
    print('The Person is dead')
This snippet predicts the survival status of a patient based on their attributes. Customize input_data with relevant patient information.

Model and Prediction Logic
Model: The machine learning model used in this project was trained on COVID-19 patient data, with 0 indicating survival and 1 indicating death.
Prediction Logic: The model’s output is interpreted based on a simple condition: if the model predicts 0, the patient is classified as "alive"; if it predicts 1, they are classified as "dead."
Results
The model’s performance is evaluated on test data, providing insight into its accuracy in predicting patient survival. Evaluation metrics used include:

Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1 Score
